# This might look egrigous to you but I did for a very rational reason
# I don't want js files in my project. That's why tailwindcss is configured in a yml file.
# Why you might ask? Because I decided so.
# So instead of having a simple and easy life and move on with my day.
# I decided to write a script in go to convert yml to js by raw-dogging string interpolation.
# Should you do it? Probably not but can you smell this? It's the smell of freedom and no js.
